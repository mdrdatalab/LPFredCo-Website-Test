                        Established in 2017, the Libertarian Party of Frederick County (LPFC) is a local affiliate to the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://lpva.com">Libertarian Party of Virginia</a> and the <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.lp.org">National Libertarian Party</a>.

                    <h3>Promoting the Libertarian Party</h3>
                    <p>
                        We attend local and regional events as a vendor, which allows us to engage the public against a festive backdrop. Events we participate in include
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hosting our own public forums with guest speakers.</li>
                            <li>Seasonal events such as the Apple Blossom festival and county fairs.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Developing Libertarian Solutions</h3>
                    <p>
                        The LPFC lobbies local and state leadership on solutions that are fiscally sound and socially tolerant. We engage by
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contacting federal, state, and local government representatives.</li>
                            <li>Volunteer and coordinate community activities.</li>
                            <li>Promote our message in the local media.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Supporting Libertarian Candidates</h3>
                    <p>
                        An important function as an affiliate is to support local, state, and federal candidates in our community. We do this by
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recruiting, developing and supporting candidates and their campaigns.</li>
                            <li>Petitioning for ballot access for Libertarian candidates.</li>

                    <h2>Individual Liberty</h2>
                    <p>Libertarians believe the most important element of society is the individual, and as such protecting the rights of individuals
                    is the only proper purpose of government. Individuals own their bodies and have rights over them that other individuals, groups, and governments may not violate. Individuals have the <b>freedom</b> and <b>responsibility</b> to decide what they knowingly and voluntarily consume, and what risks they accept to their own health, finances, safety, or life.
                    <p>Libertarians believe that individuals have the right to live in whatever manner they choose, so long as they do not forcibly or
                    fraudulently interfere with the equal rights of others.
                    <p>Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government’s treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws. Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict personal relationships. Consenting adults should be free to choose their own sexual practices and personal relationships.
                    <p>Libertarians want all members of society to have abundant opportunities to achieve economic success. A free and competitive market allocates resources in the most efficient manner. Each person has the right to offer goods and services to others on the free market. The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected.

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 plat">
                    <h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>
                    <p>With great freedom, comes great responsibility. Individuals should be free to make choices for themselves and must accept responsibility for the consequences of the choices they make. Our support of an individual’s right to make choices in life does not mean that we necessarily approve or disapprove of those choices.
                    <p>Providing for oneself and one's family is ultimately the responsibility of the individual. Recognizing that a free and competitive market
                    of voluntarily interactions allocates resources in the most efficient manner, Libertarians believe that education, health care, and retirement
                    are best handled by the individuals, not the government.
                    <p>Similarly, caring for those in need is a task government has proven itself incapable of handling. The proper and <b>most effective</b> source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals. We would seek to restore the compassionate support mechanisms of the family and community that have been eroded by decades of government interference.
                    <p>Free markets require that those who enjoy the possibility of profits must not impose the risk of losses upon others, such as through government guarantees, bailouts, and subsidies. While fraud must be combated, individuals are responsible for understanding and bearing the risks of investments and entrepreneurial activities.
                    <p>The prescribed role of government is to protect the rights of every individual including the right to life, liberty and property. Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. We reject the notion that crimes are committed against the state or society, especially victimless "crimes". A crime requires a wronged party, and wrongs require equitable remedy. We support restitution to the victim to the fullest degree possible at the expense of the criminal or the negligent wrongdoer.

                    <h2>Limited Government</h2>
                    <p>The protection of individual rights is the only proper purpose of government. Government is constitutionally limited so as to prevent the infringement of individual rights by the government itself.
                    <p>Libertarians would restore government to its purpose of protecting life, liberty, and property. As all persons are entitled to keep the fruits of their labor, we call for the repeal of the income tax, the abolishment of the Internal Revenue Service and all federal programs and services not required under the U.S. Constitution.
                    <p>Further, government should not incur debt, which burdens future generations without their consent.
                    <p>We support the maintenance of a sufficient military to defend the United States against aggression. The United States should both avoid entangling alliances and abandon its attempts to act as policeman for the world. Libertarians believe American foriegn policy should seek an America at peace with the world, and removing government impediments to free trade.
